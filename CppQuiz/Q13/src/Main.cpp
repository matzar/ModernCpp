	 *[basic.start.dynamic]�6.6.3�5 in the standard:
"It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a non-local inline variable with static storage duration is sequenced before the first statement of main or is deferred. If it is deferred, it strongly happens before any non-initialization odr-use of that variable."

Since A() is not constexpr, the initialization of a is dynamic. There are two possibilities:
- a is initialized before main() is called, i.e. before b or c are initialized.
- a is not initialized before main(). It is however guaranteed to be initialized before the the use of any function defined in the same translation unit, i.e. before the constructors of b and c are called.

Then, b and c are initialized in order.

Before main() exits, b and c are destructed in the reverse order of their construction. Then, when main() returns, a is destructed as per �6.6.4 in the standard:
"Destructors for initialized objects (...) with static storage duration are called as a result of returning from main."
